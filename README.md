Synthetic Dataset Impact on Monocular Depth Estimation Model Robustness

**To view dataset:**
The dataset is too large to add here, even as a tar. We initially tried adding/accessing it via huggingface but could not get the dataloader script to work so the formatting was all wrong. We ended up just cloning the dataset to the workspace and manually loading data. Nonetheless you can still see the data here: [huggingface_dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/julietter/final_project_synthetic_depth_v2)
